Hello Everyone,

I am Chandrasekar Sivaraman, I am currently learning basics concepts of deep learning which would enable me to 
implement a gesture recognition system. I am making this write up as a process to record my observations and also with 
the hope that it could serve as a platform for me to share my learnings to help people who are taking their first steps 
into the world of deep learning.

This repo is a collection of scripts that I have made in an attempt to better understand some underlying concepts 
of deep learning. I will mention all the major sources that I have used which I personally found to be the most effective 
in shaping my understanding of the important concepts. 

Starting Point(just a suggestion) :
I would first recommend to begin with the deep learning course on coursera by Andrew .N.G 
This would cover all the basics which you require.

I would also highly recommend reading through the materials in this course : http://cs231n.github.io/

Assuming that you have some understanding of a basic neuron and a single neuron network, The next step would be to
try implementing a neural network on your own using just basic libraries. This following blog by adam trask will be 
very helpful to you in this regard: https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was the biggest factor in plummetting the research in the field of deep learning. 
Even though CNNs were first successfully implemented by Yan Le Cun in the 90s for hand digit recognition, the CNNs became
popular only in 2012(built by Alex Krizhevsky and team) convincingly beat all the previous models used in the ImageNet competition by dropping the classification error from 26% to 15%. If you are one of those nerds who likes to read research papers, here is a list of papers of historic importance in the field of deep learning in the chronological order.
